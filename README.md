Our Google Chrome extension is meant to save a reader's place on the page, so that you'll never lose your place again! 

### To Add a Bookmark (Add Scrollmarker tab)
The user clicks on the owl icon on a page they want to add a bookmark on, scrolls down to where they left off, and presses "Place Bookmark" to drop their place. If that's the correct place, the user can finalize the bookmark by pressing the "Add Bookmark" button. 

### To View or Delete a Bookmark (View Scrollmarker tab)
The user can toggle to the View Scrollmarker tab to see their list of bookmarkers. From there, they can choose to delete a bookmark or go to a page they saved.
